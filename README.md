# Danulal's personal zsh config files
clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/Danulal/zsh.conf ~/.zsh && cd ~/.zsh && git submodule update --init``` to your home folder and symlink the .zshrc to replace the old .zshrc with ```ln -s ~/.zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc```

## Important note!
If you get an error along the lines of ```bad math expression: illegal character: ^M``` or ```zsh parse error near `\n'``` you need to convert the files to unix line endings
